## Description

In this project I develop a small program capable of causing great havoc. Although the greatest virtue of ransomware is its ability to spread through networks of hundreds of computers, in this case, my program will only affect a small part of files.

## Installation

Copy `stockholm.py` to the machine to be infected.

## Usage

Launch `stockholm.py`. The program has these options:
- The option "–version" or "-v" will show the version of the program.
- The option "–reverse" or "-r" followed by the key entered as an argument will reverse the infection.
- The option "–silent" or "-s" will not produce any output.
